# CSS Practice Lab

This lab has three files:

* *index.html*: an html file that contains the content of an hypotetic website
  that contains reviews about various spots in Northhampton.

* *Expected.png*: a screenshot of (one of the possible) ways that the website could
  be styled using CSS (no changes in the HTML) to look a bit more
  professional.

* *style.css*: the css that we used to style the website in the PNG file.

Your task is to try to replicate our design, or to work on a solution of your own
if you don't like our style (Style is a very personal thing, although experienced
web designers give us many useful suggestions).
