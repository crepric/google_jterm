# Basic Python Unit Testing

This is the simple testing code that we used in class.

The `code.py` file is the simplest python file we can imagine.
It has two functions:

* `returnNone`: returns None when called
* `returnArgument`: returns the arguments that it is called with.

The `test.py` imports the `code.py` module, and
checks the functions behavior using the unit tests class.

To run the test simply run:

```
python test.py
```
