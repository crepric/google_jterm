# Python Unit Testing Lab

This three folders contain each a python file that implements a solution to
an actual interview question that was used at Google in the past.

Each file starts with the description of the question, followed by an 
implementation.

The implementations are not guaranteed to be correct.

Your task is to implement a unit test for each case, using our basic test
as template, and if the tests fail, try to realize wether it is your tests that are
faulty, or our implementation.
